# ** Term Deposit Prediction **

* This project aims to create a fuzzy inference system that assesses the subscription of term-deposit based on bank marketing data.

* In artificial intelligence (AI) systems, fuzzy logic is used to imitate human reasoning and cognition. Rather than strictly binary cases of truth, fuzzy logic includes 0 and 1 as extreme cases of truth but with various intermediate degrees of truth.

* fuzzy logic in AI provides a way to handle and process uncertain or imprecise information, enabling AI systems to deal with real-world complexities and capture human-like reasoning
